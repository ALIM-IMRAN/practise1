            <p>
                Peter Quill was born in late 1980 to Meredith Quill and Ego, making him a hybrid of human and Celestial.
                His conception was all part of a plot set up by his father to produce a second Celestial, whose power he
                could use to complete the Expansion, which involved assimilating millions of worlds into Ego's very
                being. Peter was only one in thousands of different children that Ego conceived over the course of
                millions of years, though all who came before him were killed and thrown aside, failing to meet Ego's
                expectations.
